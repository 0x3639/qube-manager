# Qube Manager Configuration
# This file controls which Nostr relays and developers your node trusts

# Nostr relay URLs to connect to
# These relays distribute upgrade and reboot signals
relays:
  - wss://qubestr.zenon.info
  - wss://qubestr.zenon.red

# Trusted developer npubs (Nostr public keys)
# The node will only accept upgrade/reboot signals from these developers
# Default: Official HC1 (HyperCore One) developers
follows:

# Minimum number of developer signatures required to execute an action
# Recommended: At least 3 out of 6 for production deployments
# Lower values = faster upgrades, higher risk of single compromised key
# Higher values = slower upgrades, better security
quorum: 3

# Network identifier - only process events for this network
# Options: "hqz" (mainnet), "testnet", etc.
# This prevents cross-network signal confusion
network: hqz

# Unique identifier for this node (auto-generated on first run)
# Do not modify unless you know what you're doing
